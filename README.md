# Arc Theme Colora Collection

Since the arc theme is constantly in evolution and the same goes for cinnamon and linux mint, I made this github to make a division between cinnamon versions.

Linux Mint 18 has standard cinnamon 3.0+ and Linux Mint 18.1 has standard version 3.2+


You can find your personal cinnamon version when you type the following code in the terminal

    cinnamon --version

But the best thing to do always, is to run the scripts yourself on your personal setup. This will always be the best option.

More information how to do just that, can be found here.

# F  A  Q
--------------------

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al 

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename

#But that is the fun in Linux.

You can do whatever <b>Y O U</b> want.

Share the knowledge.
